# The Subtle Art of A/B Testing

This is where I jot down my A/B Testing notes. I'm sorting out all the info I can find, from start to finish of an average test.

## Main References

So far, I've been leaning on these:

- **Udacity's A/B Testing Course** - It's my go-to guide, really gets into the nitty-gritty, taught by Google experts with loads of experience.
- **Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing** - Offers a broad overview, covering a lot of ground. Great as a reference.

I'll add more papers and stuff as I go, especially the ones I keep coming back to.

## About This Repo

I'm trying to get all the A/B testing stuff that's in my head and from these sources into one place. If you're into A/B testing, maybe you'll find this useful. Or maybe you've got something to add. That'd be cool, too.
